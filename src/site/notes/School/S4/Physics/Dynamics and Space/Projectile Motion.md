# Projectile Motion

### Introduction to Projectiles
A projectile in physics is an object which ==moves under the influence of gravity==, following a parabolic path. Projectiles can move both ==horizontally== and ==vertically==.

When we do calculations we must keep the horizontal and vertical quantities separate - the vertical acceleration is ==constant== as defined by the ==gravitational field strength==, and there is ==no horizontal acceleration== but a ==constant speed== (assuming no air resistance or other forms of friction).

```ad-example
title: Example projectile calculation

An object is projected horizontally at **15ms<sup>-1</sup>**. It takes **3s** for it to hit the ground.

1. What **horizontal distance** did the object travel?
    - $d=vt$
    - $d=15\times3$
    - ==$d=45\ m$==

2. What was the **final speed** of the object as it hit the ground?
    - $a=\frac{\Delta v}{t}$
    - $v=at$
    - $v=9.8\times3$
    - ==$v=29.4\ ms^{-1}$==

3. What was the **original height** of the object?
    - $d=\frac{\Delta v\ \Delta t}{2}$
    - $d=\frac{29.4\times3}{2}$
    - ==$d=44.1\ m$==
