# Using your Knowledge of Chemistry Questions
---

### Example Question
> 13. The force of attraction between oppositely charged particles is important in chemistry.
>     **Using your knowledge of chemistry**, explain why this force of attraction is important.

- Electrons are negatively charged subatomic particles, and their repulsion against each other is what allows for the flow of electricity.
    - Dynamos used for generating an electric current function by rapidly spinning a magnet in a coil of wire. The shifting electromagnetic field around the magnet creates a force on the electrons, and the repulsion of electrons against each other causes a domino effect which pushes electrons around a circuit.
    - The inverse process is also possible in a motor, where the electric current creates a field which acts on a magnet, rotating it around an axle.
