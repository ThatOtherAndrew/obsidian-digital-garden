# Formation of Cliffs and Wave-cut Platforms
---

### Wave-cut Platform Formation
- Cliffs of hard or resistant rock (e.g. granite or limestone) are eroded by the constant crashing of waves, especially by destructive waves in winter.
- Erosion by [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Coasts and Wave Processes#Hydraulic Action|hydraulic action]] and [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Coasts and Wave Processes#Abrasion Corrasion|abrasion]] is concentrated at the base of the cliff cutting a wave cut notch.
- Extreme undercutting causes the steep or over-hanging cliff above to collapse under its own weight.
- Over time, a new wave cut notch is formed, causing the cliff to retreat. This leaves behind a wave cut platform of gently sloping rock.
- This happens at the base of the intertidal zone, and is polished by [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Coasts and Wave Processes#Abrasion Corrasion|abrasion]] in the swash and backwash of the waves.
