# Glaciers and Erosional Processes
---

### What is a glacier?
A glacier is a large body of ice, which is formed from compressed snow at a high altitude, and moves downhill. Glaciers tend to have a very strong erosional capabilities, and can carve the land which they move through.

### Erosional Processes
##### Abrasion
As ice moves along rock, it rubs against it and creates friction, eroding away at the rock like sandpaper.
##### Plucking
Ice freezes around jagged pieces of rock, locking onto it. As the heavy ice moves downhill under gravity, it breaks off the pieces of rock and carries it along.
##### Freeze-thaw weathering
Water seeps into cracks in the rock, and freezes. Since ice takes up more volume than water, when the temperature drops, it shatters the rock when it expands. When the ice melts, it fills more of the crack, and the process repeats until the rock is broken up.
