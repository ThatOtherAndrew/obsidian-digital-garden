### Coastal Land Uses in the UK
In the UK, 23% of our total land area lies within 10km of the coast. 17 million people live within this coastal zone and this level of usage puts pressure on our natural coasts, leading to a need for coastal management schemes.

```ad-question
title: How is the land along the coast used?

- 32% Pastoral farming
- 25% Arable farming
- 30% Buildings, roads and recreational facilities
- 10% Woodland and heathland habitat
- 3% Natural cliffs, beaches and mudflats

### Case Study: Tourism at the Dorset Coast
The Dorset coast has many resorts such as Swanage, providing tourist services including hotels, souvenir shops and restaurants.

Beautiful beaches such as Chesil Beach (a [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Formation of Depositional Features|tombolo]]) enable sunbathing and beach sports to take place. Dorset coast also prvides opportunities for different water sports, including swimming, water skiing and yachting.

There are a number of historic attractions which bring visitors to the area. These include [Corfe Castle](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/corfe-castle), [Hardy's Cottage](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hardys-cottage) and a number of historic ruins. Activities also include fossil hunting, and the unusual geology of the area enables educational groups to study a variety of rock types.

The area along the Dorset coast has many coastal footpaths such as the [South West Coast Path](https://www.southwestcoastpath.org.uk/) wherewalkers can enjoy the stunning and varied scenery. People come to see and photograph landscape features such as [Lulworth Cove](https://lulworth.com/visit/places-to-visit/lulworth-cove/), [Durdle Door](https://www.visit-dorset.com/listing/durdle-door/126276301/), [Old Harry Rocks](https://www.visit-dorset.com/listing/old-harry-rocks/130693301/) and the [Tilly Whim Caves](https://www.virtual-swanage.co.uk/things-to-do/local-attractions/tilly-whim-caves).

The coastline also has diverse wildlife, because of the variety of habitats that are formed here such as sand dunes, lagoons, salt flats and calm [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Formation of Bays, Headlands and Coves|bays]]. [Durlston Head](https://www.swanage.co.uk/durlston-head/) is famous for bird watching whilst [Brownsea Island](https://www.dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk/brownsea-island) is a nature reserve, home to red squirrels and wildfowl.

### Renewable Energy
Wind farms are suitable at the coast because there are constant, reliable winds.

Wave power is suitable at the south-west coast of England because of the long fetch across the Atlantic ocean.

Farmers may invest in renewable energy near the coast for diversification purposes, to boost their income.

```ad-note
Nuclear fission power plants are often constructed near the coast due to the vast quantities of water needed to pump through the reactor, however it's not renewable.
