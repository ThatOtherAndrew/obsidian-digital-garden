# Formation of a Corrie
---

### The Start of a Glacier
1. Snow accumulates at a high altitude in a north-facing hollow, on the side of a mountain.
2. The snow compresses into <abbr title="Partially compacted snow, halfway to becoming ice">firn/névé</abbr> under its own weight, then turning into dense ice.
3. As gravity pulls the heavy ice downhill, [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Glaciers and Erosional Processes#Abrasion|abrasion]] deepens the hollow by grinding away at the rock floor, while [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Glaciers and Erosional Processes#Plucking|plucking]] and [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Glaciers and Erosional Processes#Freeze-thaw weathering|freeze-thaw weathering]] steepen the sides of the corrie and make it more jagged.
4. While the ice flows downhill, more snowfall at the corrie creates more new ice, becoming the source for the growing glacier.
