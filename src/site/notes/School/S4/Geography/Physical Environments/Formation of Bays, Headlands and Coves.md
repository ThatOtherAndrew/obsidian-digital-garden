# Formation of Bays, Headlands and Coves
---
### Starter Questions
1. The two processes that are likely to erode a bay are what?
    - [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Coasts and Wave Processes|Hydraulic action]] and [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Coasts and Wave Processes|abrasion]]
2. If a beach was to form in the bay, what process would have played a key role?
    - [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Coasts and Wave Processes|Attrition]]
3. Which type of waves are likely to create a bay, and why?
    - [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Coasts and Wave Processes|Constructive waves]]
4. Which process would contribute to considerable beach deposits in some bays?
    - Longshore drift

### Formation of Bays and Headlands

Bays are formed when a band of softer rock is eroded faster, creating a concave shape. The adjacent harder rock is left sticking outwards, and becomes a headland.

### Concordant and Discordant Coastlines

A concordant coastline has bands of different rock types running parallel to the coast, resulting in straight, smooth coastlines. A discordant coastline has alternating rock types perpendicular to the coastline, creating many bays and headlands.

### Formation of a Cove
Coves form on [[School/S4/Geography/Physical Environments/Formation of Bays, Headlands and Coves|concordant coastlines]] where the geology is parallel to the coastline. Hard bands of rock exposed at the coast are eroded at a point of weakness. The sea forces its way through the gap into the soft rock behind it, and a cove is carved out in the area of softer rock.

Waves refract as they enter the cove, hence it remains relatively small in size. An example is [Lulworth Cove](https://lulworth.com/visit/places-to-visit/lulworth-cove/) in Dorset.
