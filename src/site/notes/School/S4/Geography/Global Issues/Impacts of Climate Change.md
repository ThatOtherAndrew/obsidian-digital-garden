# Impacts of Climate Change
---

### Tipping Points
Scientists believe if we warm the planet by 2°C, we will encounter irreversible tipping points, causing irreversible damage which is impossible or very difficult to reverse. Examples of tipping points are:
- Permafrost melting can release methane gas trapped in the ground, which is a potent greenhouse gas, greatly enhancing the greenhouse effect
- Melting ice caps will reduce the albedo effect, where the ice and snow reflects radiation from the sun back out into space, causing the earth to absorb more energy and heat up even more
- Rainforest ecosystems could become unstable from the changes in the tropical climate, and transform into savannahs as a result, killing off vast amounts of carbon sink plants and trees

### Human Impacts
- Increase in refugees, e.g. due to melting of the Hindu Kush ice caps making land at the meltwater river valleys no longer as suitable for farming
- Severe heatwaves will affect major developed cities as well as poorer areas which will make work difficult, causing issues for the economy and the health of the population, as well as impeding travel for the elderly
- Over 600 million small subsistence farms are vulnerable to reduced fertility due to climate change, and since they produce a third of the world's food supply, there will be an increased frequency and severity of famines
- 10% of the world's population lives less than 10m above sea level, so the rising sea levels will seriously disrupt or destroy their homes
- Currently 40% of the planet doesn't have water security, which will get worse due to melting glaciers and ice caps no longer supplying rivers, and could trigger international conflicts over water. An example is the "China Water Tower" in Tibet, known as **三江源** ("Three river source"), which China is trying to take control of

### Environmental Impacts
- Increased frequency and severity of storms, due to higher temperatures evaporating more water off the surface of the seas and oceans, and stronger winds due to more depressions forming from jet streams becoming disrupted
- Coral reefs are dying off, due to being "bleached" from the oceans becoming too warm and acidic, causing a chain reaction of issues for aquatic ecosystems
- **A**tlantic **M**eridional **O**verturning **C**irculation (AMOC), the ocean current system powered by cold water sinking at the poles, could become disrupted due to temperatures increasing at the poles and drastically affect weather systems as a result.
- Lack of rainfall causes soil to dry out, and various plants and grasses will die, causing the soil to no longer be held together by the plant roots. This leaves it vulnerable to soil erosion from winds, and results in desertification
- Species distribution in ecosystems would be thrown off balance, for example fewer coldwater fish present around the UK is increasing the local population of killer whales
- Massive icebergs such as the A74 iceberg (with a surface area of 1270km²!) are breaking off in chunks from the Antarctic ice sheets due to "ice calving", a range of processes which causes ice sheets and shelves to break apart

### Key Statistics
- Sea level is estimated to rise around ==80cm== by 2100, with an increase of ==20cm== already
- We are currently on track for a ==2.7°C== temperature increase by 2100, relative to pre-industrial times
- Global temperatures have already increased by ==1.2°C== since the industrial revolution
- AMOC ocean currents are already ==20% weaker== than the 1980s
- Antarctica has warmed by ==1°C== in the past 50 years, with some ice sheets losing ==30m== of ice in the last 10 years
