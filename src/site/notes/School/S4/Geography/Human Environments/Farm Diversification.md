# Farm Diversification
---

### What is Diversification?
Diversification is when farmers use other methods to boost their income in addition to traditional farming. Farmers can make an income from adding accomodation, farm shops and attractions, tours, agricultural exhibits, country sports, and more.

Examples of common forms of diversification include fruit picking, horse-riding, quad biking and campsites.

### Benefits of Diversification
- Diversification allows farmers to become more independent, and less reliant on government subsidies.
- Farmers can make money from land which has been taken out of crop production.
- Increased farm visitation means more people experience rural landscapes and outdoor activities.
- Wind farm development on farming land generates renewable energy for additional income.
    - One disadvantage of this is that wind farms can be loud and an eyesore.
