### History
Chamber music is noramlly defined as music for **a small group of players** (3 or more). This is normally one player per part.

Chamber music would typically be performed in smaller, often private, rooms. In particular, within the palaces or castles of aristocratic [[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Patronage|patrons]]. Originally, chamber music was **not** performed in large public concerts.

Some chamber music was written for amateur performers. Some aristocrats were excellent musicians, and [[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Patronage|patronage]] and commissions are important for the purpose of chamber music.

As the period progressed, chamber music became increasingly important.

### Trios, Quartets and Quintets
Some ensembles were fixed and had specific names. These ensembles always had the same combination of instruments, and they became the most important genres for our [[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Famous Classical Composers|3 composers]].

**String Trio**: Violin, Viola, Cello
**String Quartet**: Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello
**String Quintet**: Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola 1, Viola 2, Cello

Other ensembles were more flexible, although names were similar. Some of these became important genres, and others were rarer, at times even unique for specific composers. For example:

**Piano Trio**: Piano, Violin, Cello
**Clarinet Quintet** ([[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]): Clarinet, Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello
**Clarinet Trio** ([[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]): Clarinet, Viola, Piano

### Chamber Music Forms
The number and order of movements is fairly stable for many chamber music genres. This changed over time - [[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] expanded the size and number of movements.

Earlier works, particularly works by [[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] often had three movements:

| Movement | Tempo        | Form                      |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| First    | Fast         | Sonata Allegro            |
| Second   | Slow / Dance | Varied (often ternary)    |
| Finale   | Fast         | Rondo or Theme/Variations |

In later works, particularly by [[School/S5/Music/Introduction to Classical Music#Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], an extra movement was often added:

| Movement | Tempo                 | Form                     |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| First    | Fast                  | Sonata Allegro           |
| Second   | Normally slow         | Varied (often ternary)   |
| Third    | (Normally fast) Dance | Ternary (Scherzo & Trio) |
| Finale   | Fast                  | Sonata / Sonata Rondo    |

### Nested Ternary Form
A nested ternary form is a form where each section in the overall form are binary or rounded binary forms.
$$\large{(A_1\ B_1)\ (A_2\ B_2)\ (A_1\ B_1)}$$
