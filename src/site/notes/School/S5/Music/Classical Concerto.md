### Structure
Unlike [[School/S5/Music/Symphony\|symphonies]] (and sonatas, [[School/S5/Music/Chamber Music#Trios, Quartets and Quintets\|quartets]], etc.) the concerto retained the 3-movement "fast-slow-fast" structure from the Baroque concerto.

| Movement | Tempo | Form                                                          |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First    | Fast  | Usually a [[School/S5/Music/Classical Concerto#Sonata Form in Concertos\|modified sonata form]] |
| Second   | Slow  | Often a simpler form (e.g. ternary)                           |
| Third    | Fast  | Usually sonata-rondo form                                     |

#### Sonata Form in Concertos
In a classical concerto, the first movement frequently features a **double exposition** - an **orchestral exposition** and a **solo exposition**.

##### Orchestral Exposition
The orchestral exposition **does not feature the soloist**.

It normally features a full standard [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition\|sonata exposition]] of two subjects with a transition and a codetta. Crucially, it remains in the **tonic key** throughout - like the [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Recapitulation\|recapitulation]] of a standard sonata form, this means that the transition **does not modulate**.

##### Solo Exposition
The solo exposition **features the soloist interacting with the orchestra**.

It normally includes all the parts of a full standard [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition\|sonata exposition]], like the orchestral exposition. There is normally an additional orchestral <abbr title="A recurring musical passage which references an earlier theme">ritornello</abbr>. Crucially, it uses the normal **contrasts in key** seen in sonata form.

| Section            | Performed By          | Key                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| First solo subject | Soloist and orchestra | Tonic                                    |
| Transition         | Soloist and orchestra | Modulation to dominant or relative minor |
| Second subject     | Soloist and orchestra | Dominant or relative minor               |
| Middle ritornello  | Orchestra only        | Dominant                                 |
| Codetta            | Soloist and orchestra | Dominant or relative minor               |
