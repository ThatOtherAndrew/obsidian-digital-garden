The first movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 5 in G Major is an example of a piece in [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Sonata Form\|sonata form]], a structure developed from [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Rounded Binary Form\|rounded binary form]] which is commonly used throughout, and even after, the [[School/S5/Music/Classical Period\|classical period]]. It is comprised of an [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition\|exposition]], [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Development\|development]] and [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Recapitulation\|recapitulation]], with two [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Subjects\|subjects]], forming a very structured piece reminiscent of the classical music of the time.

The piece begins with the [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition\|exposition]], which introduces the first and second subjects to the listener for the first time. It begins with the first subject at the start of the piece without an introduction and showcases a few identifiable musical ideas, such as the dotted quaver and semiquaver rhythmic pattern in the right hand with an Alberti bass-like accompaniment in the left hand, and fast semiquaver scale runs such as in bars 8-9 and 14-15. This is followed by a [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Transition Between Subjects\|transition]] beginning in bar 16, an ascending pattern which cleverly disguises a modulation to the dominant, D major, by sharpening the subdominant note of the scale, in this case the C# in bar 21. This modulation leads into the second subject of the exposition, a section contrasting with the first subject in key and new musical ideas - for example, the syncopated right-hand melody in bars 23-24 and 45-46, or the chromatic descending pattern in bars 33-34 and 38-39. The second subject is rounded off by a codetta in bars 51-53 before a repeat back to the start, completing the exposition.

After the repeat, the key of D major from the second subject carries over into the [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Development\|development]], a section which takes the musical ideas introduced in the exposition and develops them further.
