### Binary Form
Binary form is an `AB` form, where you have two contrasting musical parts in the piece. However in practice, each part is often repeated once, creating an `AABB` structure which can be notated as follows:

> $$||:\ \ A\ \ :||:\ \ B\ \ :||$$

### Rounded Binary Form
A rounded binary form is like a repeated [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Binary Form|binary form]], but with a return to the `A` part in the second repeat. This "rounds off" the piece, and creates a sense of narrative. It can be notated as follows:

> $$||:\ \ A\ \ :||:\ \ B\ \ \ A\ \ :||$$

### Sonata Form
Sonata form is **not** a ternary form; it developed from [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Rounded Binary Form|rounded binary form]]. It is a development from opera.

The [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition|exposition]] is section `A`, which is normally repeated in full. The [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Development|development]] and [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Recapitulation|recapitulation]] form section `B` together, and is also repeated.

As sonata forms developed, this binary structure was gradually lost.

#### Exposition
The exposition sets out contrasting themes ==and keys==. It begins with an **introduction** in the tonic key, then leads into the [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition|first subject]]. The [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition|first and second subjects]] are separated by a **transition**, then it is ended with a **codetta**.

##### Subjects
The exposition has two main themes, which we call the **first and second subjects**.

The **first subject** is a statement of the melody in the tonic key. The **second subject** is a contrasting idea in a related key; normally the dominant or relative key. This results in a **modulation** between the subjects handled by the **transition**, usually `I -> V` in major and `i -> III` in minor.

#### Development
The development takes the ideas heard in the exposition and **develops** them. It can be understood as an exploration of the tension created by the contrasts between the first and second subject.

##### Examples of Development
- **Motifs and short phrases** from the [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition|exposition]] may be examined or extended.
- **New themes** may be added.
- **Tonal contrasts** are extended as different keys are explored.

#### Recapitulation
The recapitulation resolves the contrasts in key, bringing back together the two [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition|subjects]].

##### Transition Between Subjects
In the exposition, the function of the transition between the two [[School/S5/Music/Sonata Form#Exposition|subjects]] is to modulate from the tonic to a related key. However, in the recapitulation both subjects are **in the same tonic key**. As a result, the transition becomes a bit of a crunch point - since it needs to not modulate.
