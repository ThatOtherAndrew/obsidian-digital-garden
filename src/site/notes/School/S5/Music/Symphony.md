### Definition
A symphony is a **baroque genre which preceded an opera or oratorio**, and developed from the Italian Overture. It is a self-contained piece, with a quick-slow-quick pattern. It expanded significantly during the time of [[School/S5/Music/Classical Period#Joseph Haydn\|Haydn]], [[School/S5/Music/Classical Period#Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\|Mozart]] and [[School/S5/Music/Classical Period#Ludwig van Beethoven\|Beethoven]].

The symphony became arguably the most important genre of the [[School/S5/Music/Classical Period\|Classical period]], and were certainly the most important genre in public concerts - new composers could make a name for themselves from a successful symphony. This is different to a concerto in that the focus is on the composer rather than the performer.

### Haydn
