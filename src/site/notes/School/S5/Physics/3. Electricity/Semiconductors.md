### Definition
A semiconductor is a material which has a small [[School/S5/Physics/3. Electricity/Semiconductors#Band Gap\|band gap]] between its [[School/S5/Physics/3. Electricity/Semiconductors#Valence Band\|valence band]] and [[School/S5/Physics/3. Electricity/Semiconductors#Conduction Band\|conduction band]]. Semiconductors have a conductivity between that of insulators and conductive metals.

The properties of semiconductors can be explained by **energy bands** - the energy levels for a crystal or lattice structure, created by the many energy levels of the atoms in the lattice being put together.

#### Valence Band
The valence band is the **highest energy band** occupied by electrons at **absolute zero**. Electrons in this band **require the least energy to bring up** to the [[School/S5/Physics/3. Electricity/Semiconductors#Conduction Band\|conduction band]].

#### Conduction Band
The conduction band is the **lowest energy band** in which electrons are **delocalised** - meaning that they can move freely between atoms in the material. Electrons being present in the conduction band of a material allows it to conduct electricity.

#### Band Gap
The gap between a valence band and conduction band is called the **band gap**. The larger the band gap is, the more energy is required for electrons to jump across it between the valence and conduction bands.

Insulators have a large band gap, and require a lot of energy for the electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction band - which is what makes the material insulative. Conductors, on the other hand, have *no* band gap, as their valence and conduction bands are overlapping.
