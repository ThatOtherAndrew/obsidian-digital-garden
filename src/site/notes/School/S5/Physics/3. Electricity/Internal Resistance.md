### Explanation
All electrical cells have some amount of resistance inside of them - whether unintentionally, due to the natural resistance of the materials the cell is made out of, or intentionally, for safety reasons in certain high-voltage applications. This is known as **internal resistance**.

The symbol for internal resistance is $\large r$.

> [!warning] Don't get your Rs mixed up!
> 
> $\large r$ (lowercase) is for **internal resistance**.
> $\large R$ (uppercase) is for **load resistance**.

### Electromotive Force
The electromotive force (EMF) of a circuit is the **energy transferred into the circuit per unit of charge**. It is equal to the **voltage across a cell, excluding the internal resistance**.

Since EMF is a voltage, we can use the [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Electric Fields#Voltage\|voltage formula]], $\large W = QV$.

### Terminal Potential Difference
The terminal potential difference, or terminal voltage, is the **voltage across the entire power supply, including its internal resistance**. This is also equal to the potential difference across the load - since both form identical circuits!

### Lost Volts
The actual productive voltage of a power supply with internal resistance will be lower than its [[School/S5/Physics/3. Electricity/Internal Resistance#Electromotive Force\|EMF]], because some voltage is lost on the internal resistance. This lost voltage is known as **lost volts**.

Since the ratio of voltage across components in a series circuit is equal to the ratio of the components' respective resistance (as it is a [[School/S5/Physics/3. Electricity/Electrical Circuits#Potential Divider\|potential divider circuit]]), the greater the resistance of the load, the less the lost volts are.
