### Direct Current
**Direct current**, or **DC**, is a type of current in which electrons all flow **in the same direction**. It does not have to be a constant voltage - any **absolute function** can be a DC function. In other words, it **never dips below the X axis** of a voltage-time graph.

### Alternating Current
**Alternating current**, or **AC**, is a type of current in which the direction the electrons are flowing in **rapidly changes**.

#### Peak Voltage
The peak voltage is the **maximum** instantaneous voltage reached by an AC waveform. It can be thought of as the **amplitude** of the wave, assuming the wave is centred at the X axis without any deflection.

#### RMS Voltage
The <abbr title="Root Mean Squared">RMS</abbr> voltage of a <abbr title="shaped like a sine or cosine wave">sinusoidal</abbr> AC waveform is the **DC equivalent** which gives the **same amount of average power**. It is always **less than the peak voltage**.

> [!warning]
> While it may be tempting to think of this as the average absolute voltage, or even just the average voltage, it is **not** the same!

#### Formula
