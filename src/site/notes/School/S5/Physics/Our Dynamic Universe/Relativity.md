### Frames of Reference
An **inertial frame of reference** is a snapshot of a part of spacetime, which is all travelling at a constant velocity.

### Galilean Invariance
Galilean invariance states that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial [[School/S5/Physics/Our Dynamic Universe/Relativity#Frames of Reference|frames of reference]]. For example, doing an experiment on a vehicle moving at a constant speed will yield the same results as doing it on stationary land.

### Classical Relativity
In classical relativity, velocities can be added together to get the velocity that an object appears to be moving relative to an observer.

### Special Relativity

#### Einstein's Postulates
Einstein made two postulates when thinking about relativity, building off classical relativity:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
2. The speed of light in a perfect vacuum is the same for all observers.

#### The Light Clock
To explore the effect this would have on physics, Einstein considered a thought experiment called the light clock.

Consider two perfect mirrors facing perfectly opposite each other, so that a short pulse of light travelling perpendicularly in between them would be trapped forever bouncing back and forth. When stationary, the light would bounce off a mirror at a steady rhythm.

If we start moving this contraption horizontally, then the distance the light would cover from our frame of reference would be in a triangular wave shape, as shown below. However, the light now has to cover a further distance. We cannot add on velocity if we follow postulate 2, therefore by the equation $d=vt$ the **time taken for light to bounce must increase**.

#### Time Dilation
But how can the time taken increase if light is still travelling at the same speed? The actual rate of time progression would have to change - which sounds very strange, but is actually what happens. A moving clock will appear to be running slower for a stationary observer. This process is called **time dilation**.

The frame you are observing from is not moving relative to you, and the time you observe would be **normal time**. The time you observe in a frame travelling relative to you would be the **dilated time**.

#### Time Dilation Formula

$$\huge{t' = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}}$$

> [!info] Variable Key
> 
> - $t'$ is dilated time in seconds
> - $t$ is normal time in seconds
> - $v$ is the velocity of the moving object in $ms^{-1}$
> - $c$ is the speed of light in $ms^{-1}$ as a constant

> > A person on a rocket observes 30 seconds. The rocket travels at $2.9\times10^8$ ms<sup>-1</sup> as viewed from Earth. What time is observed on the rocket's clock as viewed from Earth?

> \begin{align}

> &= 117.170... \\
> &= 117\ \textup{s}
> \end{align}

#### Coefficient Notation
Often when expressing a certain proportion of the speed of light, it would be notated by a number multiplied by $c$, the speed of light. This helps to keep notes and calculations tidy and readable.

For example, half of the speed of light would be $0.5c$ and 99% of the speed of light would be $0.99c$.
