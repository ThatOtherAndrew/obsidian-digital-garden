### The Big Bang Theory
The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe started at one point 13.8 billion years ago.

There are a number of pieces of evidence for this:
- [[School/S5/Physics/Our Dynamic Universe/Doppler Effect#Redshift|Redshift]] (Hubble's Law)
- Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR)
- Abundance of Hydrogen and Helium
- The darkness of the night sky (Olbers' Paradox)

### Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
During the Big Bang there was a lot of heat, detectable as infrared radiation. This has been redshifted to a microwave signal which is detectable by television and radio receivers, and is the reason for the static noise when you are not tuned into a station.

### Black Body Radiation
Hotter objects emit more radiation than colder objects. Objects want to cool down by releasing electromagnetic radiation. This is mainly infrared, however if an object is hot enough, it will emit visible light or even higher frequency radiation.

A perfect black body is an object which absorbs and emits all parts of the electromatic spectrum equally. In a black body, the wavelengths of light released depend on on the temperature of the body.

To summarise, **the hotter the object, the shorter the peak wavelength, and the higher the intensity.**

### Dark Energy
According to Hubble's Law, $v$ is directly proportional to $d$. However, in practice, observerations show that the further away a galaxy is, the more it is accelerating away from us. There must be something causing this acceleration, which we call **dark energy**.

### Dark Matter
We can determine information about stars and galaxies in space by looking at the electromagnetic radiation emitted - but this means that if you have matter which does not emit any form of EM radiation, it is impossible for us to observe. We call this matter **dark matter**.

Our galaxy is spinning faster than it should based on calculations using the visible mass, therefore we can determine that dark matter must exist inside of it (e.g. a supermassive black hole).
