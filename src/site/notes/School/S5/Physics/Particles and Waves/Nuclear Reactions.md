### Nuclear Binding Energy
Different atoms have different **binding energies per nucleon**. If the product of a nuclear reaction has a higher nuclear binding energy than the reactants, energy is released.

Elements with a mass number less than iron can only release energy by fusion, and elements with a mass number greater than iron can only release energy by fission. This is why iron is the heaviest element producible in a star - with heavier elements only achievable during a supernova due to the immense amounts of energy available.
