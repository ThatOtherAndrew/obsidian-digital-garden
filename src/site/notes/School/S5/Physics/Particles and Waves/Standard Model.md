### Definition
The Standard Model is a theory of the elementary particles, the most fundamental particles which cannot be broken down into other particles and are the building blocks of the universe. Elementary particles fall under one of two categories: [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Fermions\|fermions]] and [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Bosons\|bosons]]. There are multiple different interpretations and depictions of the Standard Model with slight variations.

### Fermions
Fermions are particles which **make up matter**. Elementary fermions can be subdivided into two categories, [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Quarks\|quarks]] and [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Leptons\|leptons]]. Fermions have **odd half-integer spins**, e.g. $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{2}$, $\frac{5}{2}$ - with most common fermions having a spin of $\frac{1}{2}$.

> [!warning] Not all fermions are elementary!
> [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Baryons\|Baryons]] are an example of composite particles which are **also fermions**. This therefore means both **protons and neutrons are fermions**.

#### Quarks
Quarks are ~~dairy products~~ [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Fermions\|fermions]] which experience the strong nuclear force - the force which holds [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Hadrons\|hadrons]] together. There are six quarks: the **up**, **charm** and **top** quarks with a charge of $\frac{2}{3}$, and the **down**, **strange** and **bottom** quarks with a charge of $-\frac{1}{3}$. Up and down quarks are the most stable and make up protons and neutrons, and top and bottom quarks are the most massive and also the most unstable - usually decaying into other elementary particles in a split second. Each quark has an [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Antimatter\|antiparticle]] counterpart with the opposite charge, i.e. $-\frac{2}{3}$ for the antiup, anticharm and antitop particles and $\frac{1}{3}$ for the antidown, antistrange and antibottom particles.

#### Leptons
Leptons are [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Fermions\|fermions]] which, conversely to quarks, do *not* experience the strong nuclear force. There are six leptons: the **electron**, **muon** and **tau** particles, each with a charge of $-1$, and their associated [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Neutrinos\|neutrinos]]. Each charged lepton also has an [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Antimatter\|antiparticle]] counterpart with a charge of $1$: the **positron**, **antimuon** and **antitau** respectively. The neutrinos also have antineutrino counterparts, which while not having a charge, have a different type of charge negated - called the lepton number.

##### Neutrinos
Neutrinos are [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Leptons\|leptons]] without a charge, which were first theorised to explain a loss of energy in beta decay.

Below is an example of **neutron decay**, where a neutron turns into a proton, an electron and an electron antineutrino:

$$\huge {}^1_0\textup{n} \rightarrow {}^1_0\textup{p} + {}^{\ 0}_\textup{-1}\textup{e} + \overline{\textup{v}}_e$$

Initially, physicists observed that neutrons decayed into protons and electrons, which conserves mass and charge. However, the total energy held by the proton and electron was observed to be less than the energy of the neutron. According to the law of [[School/S4/Physics/Dynamics and Space/Energy, Work and Power#Conservation of energy\|conservation of energy]] this isn't possible, and that energy has to go *somewhere* - leading to the existence of neutrinos first being theorised.

### Bosons
Bosons are **force-mediating particles**, and have integer spins. All elementary bosons are [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Gauge Bosons\|gauge bosons]], with the exception of the [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Higgs Boson\|Higgs boson]], a scalar boson which is so special that it is the only boson in its category. Other bosons, such as [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Mesons\|mesons]], are composite particles.

#### Gauge Bosons
Gauge bosons are elementary bosons which act as **force carriers between elementary [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Fermions\|fermions]]** and cannot be directly detected by themselves. Each fundamental force corresponds to a type of gauge boson.

| Gauge Boson    | Force          | Effect                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Photon         | Electrostatic  | Attracts and repels charged particles                             |
| Gluon          | Strong nuclear | Holds together <abbr title="Protons and neutrons">nucleons</abbr> |
| W and Z bosons | Weak nuclear   | Causes nuclear decay and fusion                                   |

> [!info] What about gravity?
> Gravity also has a corresponding theoretical boson called the graviton, however it is often excluded because it conflicts with Einstein's theory of general relativity.

#### Higgs Boson
The Higgs boson is the only fundamental scalar boson, and it acts between matter and the Higgs field - a field of energy which gives matter the property of mass. It has zero spin and no charge, and it is famously difficult to observe - its existence has only been proven in around 2011-2013 using the [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Particle Accelerators#Synchrotron\|Large Hadron Collider]]. The Higgs boson is incredibly unstable, decaying so quickly that its decay time couldn't be directly measured.

### Hadrons
Hadrons are **composite subatomic particles made of two or more [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Quarks\|quarks]]**, held together by the strong nuclear force. They can be subdivided into two categories, [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Baryons\|baryons]] and [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Mesons\|mesons]].

The sum of charges of the quarks in a hadron determines the overall charge of the hadron. Hadrons must have an integer charge.

#### Baryons
Baryons are [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Hadrons\|hadrons]] which are **made up of an odd number of [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Quarks\|quarks]]**, usually three. Baryons are considered composite [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Fermions\|fermions]] as they have odd half-integer spins.

Protons and neutrons are two common examples of baryons. Protons are formed from two up quarks and a down quark, resulting in a charge of $1$, and neutrons are formed from an up quark and two down quarks, resulting in a charge of $0$.

#### Mesons
Mesons are [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Hadrons\|hadrons]] which are **made up of an even number of [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Quarks\|quarks]]**, usually a pairing of a quark and an antiquark. Unlike [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Baryons\|baryons]], all mesons are very unstable, with the longest-lived mesons lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Larger mesons decay to other less massive mesons, which ultimately decay into stable electrons, neutrinos and photons.

Mesons are also considered composite [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Standard Model#Bosons\|bosons]] as they have an integer spin, and can act as force carriers under certain circumstances (e.g. pions can act as force carriers between <abbr title="Protons and neutrons">nucleons</abbr>).

### Antimatter
Antimatter has **the same properties of regular matter, but the opposite charge**.

When matter comes into contact with antimatter, they **annihilate** - turning into a lot of pure energy in the form of photons. This process can also happen in reverse.

The amount of mass and energy converted can be calculated using Albert Einstein's famous formula, $E=mc^2$.
