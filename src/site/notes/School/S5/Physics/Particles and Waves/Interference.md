### National 5 Definitions

##### Transverse
A type of wave which oscillates **perpendicular** to the wave's direction of energy transfer.

##### Longitudinal
A type of wave which oscillates **parallel** to the wave's direction of energy transfer, and travels through compression and decompression of the particles in a medium.

##### Wavelength
The distance between **two peaks** of a wave.

##### Frequency
The **number of waves** which are emitted or pass a point in a fixed unit of time.

##### Amplitude
The distance from the **centre line** of a wave to the **peak** of the wave.

##### Period
The time it takes for **one complete wave cycle** to be emitted or pass a point.

##### Reflection
The **rebounding** of an object, particle or wave against a surface.

##### Refraction
The **bending** of a wave as it passes from one medium to another, caused by the difference in speed between the two mediums.

##### Diffraction
The **spreading out** of a wave as it passes through a gap, caused by the wave's interference with itself.

### Interference
**Superposition** is the **adding together** of multiple waves, causing them to interfere with one another.

##### Constructive Interference
**Constructive interference** is where the waves are **in phase**, and therefore combine to form a wave with a greater [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Interference#Amplitude\|amplitude]].

##### Destructive Interference
**Destructive interference** is where the waves are **out of phase**, and cancel each other out.

##### Maxima
When two wave peaks meet at a point, it is known as a **maximum** (plural **maxima**) - a point with the greatest possible amplitude.

In an interference pattern, the central maximum is known as the **zero order maximum**, and for each maximum away from it, the **order number** increases by one.

##### Minima
When two opposing wave peaks meet at a point, it is known as a **minimum** (plural **minima**) - a point with the smallest possible amplitude.

### Double-Slit Experiment
The double-slit experiment was first performed by Thomas Young in 1802, and demonstrates the wave-like properties of light. It accomplishes this by making light [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Interference#Diffraction\|diffract]] through two narrow slits, creating an [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Interference#Interference\|interference]] pattern.

### Path Difference
The path difference between two waves is the **difference in length** from two <abbr title="of equal frequency and phase">coherent</abbr> wave sources to a common meeting point.

If the path difference between two waves is an integer number of wavelengths, the meeting point will be a [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Interference#Maxima\|maximum]]. Similarly, if the path difference is a <abbr def="">half-integer</abbr> number of wavelengths, the meeting point will be a [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Interference#Minima\|minimum]].

#### Formula

$$\huge \textup{Path difference} = m\lambda$$

### Diffraction Gratings
A diffraction grating is a **panel which consists of many slits spaced close together**. They can be used to produce interference patterns, similar to a [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Interference#Double-Slit Experiment\|double slit]].

#### Formula

$$\huge d\sin\theta = m\lambda$$
