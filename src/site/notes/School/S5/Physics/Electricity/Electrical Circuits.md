### Potential Divider
A potential divider is a simple circuit with **multiple resistors in series**, where the voltage across the resistors is split proportional to the resistance.

### Nested Circuits

A circuit with nested series or parallel parts to it can be simplified "from inside out", much like evaluating brackets in a mathematical expression.

### Open Circuit
An open circuit is a circuit with an **infinite resistance load** connected to the power supply - which, in practice, means that the terminals of the power supply are **not connnected**.

### Short Circuit
A short circuit is the opposite of an open circuit - it's where there the terminals of the power supply are connected with **no resistance**. In practice, this usually means the terminals are connected by a wire or other conductive material with negligible resistance.
