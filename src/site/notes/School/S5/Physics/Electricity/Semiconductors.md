### Definition
A semiconductor is a material which has a small [[School/S5/Physics/Electricity/Semiconductors#Band Gap\|band gap]] between its [[School/S5/Physics/Electricity/Semiconductors#Valence Band\|valence band]] and [[School/S5/Physics/Electricity/Semiconductors#Conduction Band\|conduction band]]. Semiconductors have a conductivity between that of insulators and conductive metals.

The properties of semiconductors can be explained by **energy bands** - the energy levels for a crystal or lattice structure, created by the many energy levels of the atoms in the lattice being put together.

#### Valence Band
The valence band is the **highest energy band** occupied by electrons at **absolute zero**. Electrons in this band **require the least energy to bring up** to the [[School/S5/Physics/Electricity/Semiconductors#Conduction Band\|conduction band]].

#### Conduction Band
The conduction band is the **lowest energy band** in which electrons are **delocalised** - meaning that they can move freely between atoms in the material. Electrons being present in the conduction band of a material allows it to conduct electricity.

#### Band Gap
The gap between a valence band and conduction band is called the **band gap**. The larger the band gap is, the more energy is required for electrons to jump across it between the valence and conduction bands.

Insulators have a large band gap, and require a lot of energy for the electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction band - which is what makes the material insulative. Conductors, on the other hand, have *no* band gap, as their valence and conduction bands are overlapping.

### Doping
A pure semiconductor, such as a pure silicon lattice, is known as an **intrinsic semiconductor**. Impurities are often added to intrinsic semiconductors to increase or decrease the number of electrons in the material. This is known as **doping**, and it makes the semiconductor more conductive, as well as giving it other unique properties.

A semiconductor can be doped by diffusing the impurities as a gas into the liquid semiconductor as it is crystallising, which integrates the impurities into the resultant lattice structure. Silicon is usually doped with a ratio of one impurity atom to every million silicon atoms.

> [!warning] Charge Confusion
> It is important to note that p-type and n-type semiconductors, despite having more or less electrons than the intrinsic semiconductor counterpart, **are not** positively or negatively charged! The change in the number of protons in the nuclei of the impurity balance out the difference in electron count, so the material as a whole remains neutral in charge.

#### N-Type Semiconductors
If an element with more electrons in its outer shell is added to an intrinsic semiconductor, an **n-type semiconductor** is formed. This results in an excess of electrons in the [[School/S5/Physics/Electricity/Semiconductors#Conduction Band\|conduction band]], which is what increases the conductivity of the material.

#### P-Type Semiconductors
If the impurity added to an intrinsic semiconductor instead has less electrons, then the result is a **p-type semiconductor**. The deficiency of electrons in the material results in nearby electrons wanting to fill the empty spaces in which electrons should be present (also known as **holes**), which is what increases the conductivity of the material.

### P-N Junctions
When two adjacent parts of an intrinsic semiconductor are doped with [[School/S5/Physics/Electricity/Semiconductors#P-Type Semiconductors\|p-type]] and [[School/S5/Physics/Electricity/Semiconductors#N-Type Semiconductors\|n-type]] impurities, a **p-n junction** is formed as a result. The excess delocalised electrons in the n-type side of the junction want to move to the p-type side where there is a deficiency of electrons, with the resulting movement of electrons being known as **electron diffusion**. This results in negative ions being formed on the p-type side, and positive ions being formed on the n-type side, in a region known as the **depletion region** or **depletion layer**.
