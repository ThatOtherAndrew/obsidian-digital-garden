### Definition
Irradiance is the **power of light per unit area**.

Irradiance follows an **inverse-square law**: irradiance is **directly proportional** to the inverse square of the distance from the source.

### Formulae

---

$$\huge{I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{k}{d^2}}$$

Since $\Large{I = \frac{k}{d^2}}$, we know that $\Large{Id^2 = k}$ where $\Large{k}$ is constant. Therefore, we get:

$$\huge{I_1\ {d_1}^2\ =\ I_2\ {d_2}^2}$$
