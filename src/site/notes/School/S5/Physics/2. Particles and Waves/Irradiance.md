### Definition
Irradiance is the **power of light per unit area**.

Irradiance follows an **inverse-square law**: irradiance is **directly proportional** to the inverse square of the distance from the source.

### Formula

---

$$\huge{I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{k}{d^2}}$$

> - $P$ is power, in watts ($\textup{W}$).
> - $A$ is area, in square metres ($\textup{m}^2$).
> - $d$ is distance from the light source, in metres ($\textup{m}$).
> - $k$ is a constant, which ensures direct proportionality.
