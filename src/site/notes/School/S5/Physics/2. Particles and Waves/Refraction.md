### Definition

Refraction is when a wave **changes speed** as it travels from one [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Refraction#Medium\|medium]] to another. If a ray of light hits a new medium at an angle to the normal, it will change direction.

#### Medium
A **medium** is a material which a **wave can travel through**.

An **optical medium** is a material which **visible light can travel through**, i.e. it is **transparent** or **translucent**.

### Refractive Index

The refractive index of an [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Refraction#Medium\|medium]] is the ratio of the **speed of light in a vacuum** to the **speed of light in the medium**. This concept can also be applied to other types of wave, such as sound, in which case a different reference medium other than a vacuum has to be used as sound cannot travel through a vacuum.

Different wavelengths diffract by different amounts - shorter wavelengths diffract more. An easy way to remember this is that **Blue Bends Best**. The refractive index can also be found using the ratio of the wavelengths before and after refraction.

The refractive index **must be at least 1**, as the speed of light in a medium cannot be greater than the speed of light in a vacuum, the theoretical maximum.

The refractive index of air is $1.0003$, which for Higher purposes is considered equal to the refractive index of a vacuum ($1$), as the difference is considered negligible.

#### Relative Refractive Index

A refractive index of a [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Refraction#Medium\|medium]] can also be calculated relative to a medium the wave enters from. This can be less than 1 and can be calculated for any kind of wave.

$$\huge{n = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2}} = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}$$

### Critical Angle
The critical angle is the angle at which an incident wave creates an angle of refraction **perpendicular to the normal** (i.e. an angle of refraction of $90^\circ$). This is the threshold at which **total internal reflection** can occur, as an angle of refraction greater than $90^\circ$ would prevent the wave from escaping its source [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Refraction#Medium\|medium]]. This can only occur when the wave is travelling from a slower medium towards a faster medium.

#### Formula
The critical angle of a medium can be calculated from the refractive index, and vice versa. Since $\sin{90^\circ} = 1$, by substituting $\sin\theta_1$ we can get:
