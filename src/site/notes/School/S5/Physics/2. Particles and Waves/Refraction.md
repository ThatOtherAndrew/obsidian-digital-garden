### Definition

Refraction is when a wave **changes speed** as it travels from one [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Refraction#Medium\|medium]] to another. If a ray of light hits a new medium at an angle to the normal, it will change direction.

#### Medium
A **medium** is a material which a **wave can travel through**.

An **optical medium** is a material which **visible light can travel through**, i.e. it is **transparent** or **translucent**.

### Refractive Index

The refractive index of an [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Refraction#Medium\|medium]] is the ratio of the **speed of light in a vacuum** to the **speed of light in the medium**. This concept can also be applied to other types of wave, such as sound, in which case a different reference medium other than a vacuum has to be used as sound cannot travel through a vacuum.

The refractive index **must be at least 1**, as the speed of light in a medium cannot be greater than the speed of light in a vacuum, the theoretical maximum.

The refractive index of air is $1.0003$, which for Higher purposes is considered equal to the refractive index of a vacuum ($1$), as the difference is considered negligible.

#### Relative Refractive Index

A refractive index of a [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Refraction#Medium\|medium]] can also be calculated relative to a medium the wave enters from. This can be less than 1 and can be calculated for any kind of wave.
