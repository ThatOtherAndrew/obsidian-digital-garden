### Gold Leaf Electroscope Experiment
The gold leaf electroscope experiment **proves that light has particle-like properties**. It involves the device shown below: two thin strips of gold leaf connected to a negatively charged metal plate. Since the two gold strips will be both negatively charged, they will repel each other, and a non-fixed gold leaf will rise up. The result from shining visible and ultraviolet light on the metal plate proves that light is not simply a wave, and proves the **photoelectric effect**.

#### Wave Theory Contradiction
Using the theory of light being a wave, we can expect that shining light of any wavelength onto the metal plate would cause the gold leaf to fall. However, this is **not what happens** - the gold leaf does not fall under even the brightest visible light sources. Electrons were only released from the electronscope when high-frequency light was used, e.g. ultraviolet light.

#### Explanation
This phenomenon can be explained by the following:

1. The energy of an electromagnetic wave is directly proportional to its frequency.
2. Electromagnetic waves travel in discrete "packets", called **photons**.
3. Metals have a minimum energy threshold required per discrete photon to release electrons.

This minimum energy threshold is known as the **work function**.

> [!warning] Confusing names!
> Despite its name, a work function is **not** a function - it is a property of metals, similar to atomic number or atomic mass for example.
