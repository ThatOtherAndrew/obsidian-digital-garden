### National 5 Definitions

##### Transverse
A type of wave which oscillates **perpendicular** to the wave's direction of energy transfer.

##### Longitudinal
A type of wave which oscillates **parallel** to the wave's direction of energy transfer, and travels through compression and decompression of the particles in a medium.

##### Wavelength
The distance between **two peaks** of a wave.

##### Frequency
The **number of waves** which are emitted or pass a point in a fixed unit of time.

##### Amplitude
The distance from the **centre line** of a wave to the **peak** of the wave.

##### Period
The time it takes for **one complete wave cycle** to be emitted or pass a point.

##### Reflection
The **rebounding** of an object, particle or wave against a surface.

##### Refraction
The **bending** of a wave as it passes from one medium to another, caused by the difference in speed between the two mediums.

##### Diffraction
The **spreading out** of a wave as it passes through a gap, caused by the wave's interference with itself.
