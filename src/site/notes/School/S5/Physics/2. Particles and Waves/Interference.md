### National 5 Definitions

##### Transverse
A type of wave which oscillates **perpendicular** to the wave's direction of energy transfer.

##### Longitudinal
A type of wave which oscillates **parallel** to the wave's direction of energy transfer, and travels through compression and decompression of the particles in a medium.

##### Wavelength
The distance between **two peaks** of a wave.

##### Frequency
The **number of waves** which are emitted or pass a point in a fixed unit of time.

##### Amplitude
The distance from the **centre line** of a wave to the **peak** of the wave.

##### Period
The time it takes for **one complete wave cycle** to be emitted or pass a point.

##### Reflection
The **rebounding** of an object, particle or wave against a surface.

##### Refraction
The **bending** of a wave as it passes from one medium to another, caused by the difference in speed between the two mediums.

##### Diffraction
The **spreading out** of a wave as it passes through a gap, caused by the wave's interference with itself.

### Interference
**Superposition** is the **adding together** of multiple waves, causing them to interfere with one another.

**Constructive interference** is where the waves are **in phase**, and therefore combine to form a wave with a greater [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Interference#Amplitude\|amplitude]].

**Destructive interference** is where the waves are **out of phase**, and cancel each other out.

### Double-Slit Experiment
The double-slit experiment was first performed by Thomas Young in 1802, and demonstrates the wave-like properties of light. It accomplishes this by making light [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Interference#Diffraction\|diffract]] through two narrow slits, and create an [[School/S5/Physics/2. Particles and Waves/Interference#Interference\|interference]] pattern.
