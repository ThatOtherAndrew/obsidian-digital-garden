## Definition

Minimalism is a type of music which is made up of **limited musical material** to create **complex and emergent textures**. Notable examples of minimalist composers include [Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich) and [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(composer)). To accomplish this, minimalist composers utilise a variety of techniques:
#### Ostinato
A **continuously repeating musical pattern** - the building blocks of minimalist music.
#### Note Addition
The **gradual introduction of new notes** into an [[School/S6/Music/Minimalism#Ostinato\|ostinato]].
#### Note Subtraction
The **gradual removal of existing notes** into an [[School/S6/Music/Minimalism#Ostinato\|ostinato]].
#### Phasing
The **changing of alignment between two [[School/S6/Music/Minimalism#Ostinato\|ostinatos]]**, usually instances of the same ostinato, creating interesting resultant "interference patterns".
#### Resultant Melody
The **melody picked out by your ear** composed of **notes from different [[School/S6/Music/Minimalism#Ostinato\|ostinatos]] or parts**. This is usually the highest pitched note in each part, however it can be manipulated using **accented notes** to "force" a different resultant melody.
