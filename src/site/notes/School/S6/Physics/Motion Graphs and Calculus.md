We know that velocity is **change in displacement**, and acceleration is **change in velocity**. Calculus tells us that the rate of change of a function is the derivative, and therefore we can differentiate and integrate to convert between different functions of displacement, velocity and acceleration.

$$\huge
v=\frac{ds}{dt}\ \ \ \ \ \ a=\frac{dv}{dt}
$$
$$\huge
v=\int{a\ dt}\ \ \ \ \ \ s=\int{v\ dt}
$$
