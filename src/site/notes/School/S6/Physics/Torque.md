## Definition
Torque ( $\large \tau$ ) is the **tendency of a force to turn an object** around an axis - the angular counterpart to a linear force, hence it can be thought of as **"angular force"**.

## Moment of Inertia
Moment of inertia ( $\large I$ ) is the tendency of an object to **resist change in angular motion** - the angular counterpart to inertia, hence it can be thought of as **"angular inertia"**. Linearly, inertia is entirely dependent on mass, however with moment of inertia,
