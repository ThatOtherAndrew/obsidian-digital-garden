> [!info] Variable Key
> - $\large \color{red} F$ is **electrostatic force**, in newtons.
> - $\large \color{cyan} Q_1$ and $\large \color{cyan} Q_1$ are the **charges of the respective particles**, in coulombs.
> - $\large \color{yellow} \varepsilon_0$ is the **[[School/S6/Physics/Coulomb's Law#Vacuum Permittivity\|vacuum permittivity]]** constant.

## Vacuum Permittivity
**Vacuum permittivity**, also known as **permittivity of free space** or the **electric constant**, is a constant which determines how easy it is for an electric field to "penetrate" a vacuum, and consequently how strongly charges influence each other.

Permittivity is represented by the Greek letter epsilon, $\large \varepsilon$.
