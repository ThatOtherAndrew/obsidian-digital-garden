### Electric Potential

Imagine that we sampled every point within a space, measured the [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Electric Potential#Electric Potential\|electric potential]] at that point, and **extruded into another dimension** based on the value of that electrical potential (like a [heightmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap), for those familiar with computer graphics). In simple terms, we convert electrical potential into elevation - the higher the altitude, the higher the electrical potential, and vice versa.

When we add charges to this map, they influence the electric potential. A positive charge raises a peak of high electric potential in the map, and a negative charge sinks down and creates a well of low electric potential.

If we were considering electric potential in a 2D plane, the resulting map would look something like this in 3D:

To consider electrical potential along a 1D line, we can simply take a cross-section of this map, to get what would simply look like a graph of electrical potential (y-axis) against distance (x-axis). However, to consider electrical potential within a 3D space, that would require extrusion into a **fourth spacial dimension** - which would be a mathematically accurate model, however it would be very difficult to visualise. For the purposes of this explanation, let's stick to 3D maps representing 2D planes.

### Potential Difference

Now that we understand [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Electric Potential#Electric Potential\|electric potential]], [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Electric Fields#Voltage\|potential difference (voltage)]] is simply a **difference in altitude**. It's the **distance you have to climb up or down** on the map - the greater the climb, the greater the potential difference. Climbing up would correspond to a **positive** potential difference, whereas descending down would be **negative**.

Just as we can measure both altitude and difference in altitude using metres, we can measure both electric potential and potential difference using **volts** - despite the term of **voltage** only referring specifically to a **potential *difference***. This is a source of confusion for many!

### Field Strength

We can think of [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Electric Potential#Electric Field Strength\|electric field strength]] as being the **gradient** at a point - therefore electric field strength is a sort of multidimensional derivative of [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Electric Potential#Electric Potential\|electric potential]]. To put it simply, the electric field strength at a point is a **vector starting from that point and pointing down the slope**. The steeper the slope, the greater the magnitude of the vector - and conversely, the field strength at a flat point would have a magnitude of zero.

If we drew many of these field strength vectors and connected them up in a chain from tip to tail, the lines would represent the **path a positive test charge would take**, which wants to "roll down" to get to as low a potential it can. If this sounds familiar, good - because that is what **[[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Electric Fields#Electric Field Diagrams\|field lines]]** are! A birds-eye view of the map with the vectors drawn would look exactly like the 2-dimensional electric field diagrams you'll be familiar with.

## Electrostatic Force

The electrostatic force is simply the "gravity" in the analogy - the force which pulls positive charges downwards towards a lower electric potential, and negative charges upwards towards a greater electric potential. The strength of this force can depend on factors such as [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Coulomb's Law#Vacuum Permittivity\|permittivity]].
