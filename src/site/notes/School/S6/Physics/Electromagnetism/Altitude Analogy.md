> [!tip]+ Electric shock?
> When I first took the beginnings of these notes in class, I found it extremely difficult to gain an intuitive grasp of what all these terms and concepts meant - they all sounded vaguely similar and I had no clear picture of what they represented. During a discussion online (at 2:30 in the morning ðŸ˜¶) with a university physics student, they introduced me to a wonderful analogy which represents electric potential as elevation on a map - and suddenly, the topic became much less abstract and started making sense in my head!

> To share some of this intuition via this analogy, I'll be including further explanations which use the analogy in collapsible admonitions throughout my notes on electromagnetism. These admonitions can be clicked to be expanded, and they look like this:
