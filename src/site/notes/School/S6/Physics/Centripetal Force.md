[[School/S5/Physics/1. Our Dynamic Universe/Basics of Forces#Newton's Laws\|Newton's laws of motion]] state that an object cannot accelerate unless an unbalanced force acts upon it. In this case, a force which isn't parallel to the direction of motion is required to change the direction of an object's motion, i.e. to get it to turn.

This force is known as the **radial force** or **centripetal force**, as the force vector always points towards the centre of the circle of rotation and is hence parallel to the radius. This force can be caused by friction, gravity, tension, an electromagnetic force, or any other such force.

Using $\large F=ma$, we can calculate the centripetal force of an object with a known mass:
