## Definition
A gravitational field, similar to an [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Electric Fields\|electric field]] or a [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Magnetic Fields\|magnetic field]], is a **region where masses experience a gravitational force**. Just as with electric and magnetic fields, we can draw **gravitational field diagrams** with **gravitational field lines** which indicate the path a **test mass** would take.

## Gravitational Field Strength
Gravitational field strength is **the gravitational force acting on an object per unit of mass**. It is analogous to [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Electric Potential#Electric Field Strength\|electric field strength]] for [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Electric Fields\|electric fields]].

The gravitational field strength can be calculated at a point, if the mass and force acting on a test mass at that point is known:

## Gravitational Force
Gravitational force is simply the proper name for **weight**, but is a more universally applicable term - especially when considering interplanetary scales. We can calculate the gravitational force between two masses using **Newton's law of universal gravitation**, an **inverse-square law** which suggests that as the distance between two masses doubles, the force between them is four times weaker.

The equivalent for an [[School/S5/Physics/Particles and Waves/Electric Fields\|electric field]] is [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Coulomb's Law\|Coulomb's Law]], which is used to calculate the [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Coulomb's Law#Electrostatic Force\|electrostatic force]] between two charges.

## Gravitational Potential
Gravitational potential at a point in a gravitational field is a **scalar** which represents **[[School/S4/Physics/Dynamics and Space/Energy, Work and Power#Gravitational potential energy\|gravitational potential energy]]** (the gravitational counterpart to electric potential energy) **per unit of mass**. The formal definition of gravitational potential at a point is the energy required to move a **1 kilogram test mass** to that point from an infinitely far location, where the [[School/S6/Physics/Rotational Motion and Astrophysics/Gravitational Fields#Gravitational Field Strength\|gravitational field strength]] would be zero. For this reason, gravitational potential is **always negative** - moving a mass in the same direction as it is being pulled by [[School/S6/Physics/Rotational Motion and Astrophysics/Gravitational Fields#Gravitational Force\|gravitational force]] is equivalent to negative work done.

Gravitational potential is the **gravitational counterpart to [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Electric Potential#Electric Potential\|electric potential]]**, and both use the symbol $\large \color{violet} V$.
