## Potential Wells

If we were to plot a graph of **distance from a mass** against **[[School/S6/Physics/Rotational Motion and Astrophysics/Gravitational Fields#Gravitational Potential\|gravitational potential]]**, it would look like a funnel dropping down at the point of the mass, and approaching zero as the distance from the point approaches infinity. (If you have read the [[School/S6/Physics/Electromagnetism/Altitude Analogy\|Altitude Analogy]] page, this should sound familiar!)

## Escape Velocity

In order for a mass to escape a [[School/S6/Physics/Rotational Motion and Astrophysics/Escape Velocity#Potential Wells\|potential well]], it needs to have a sufficiently high velocity. The [[School/S6/Physics/Rotational Motion and Astrophysics/Gravitational Fields#Gravitational Potential\|gravitational potential]] will have an effect on the velocity of an object trying to escape, decreasing it - however, because of the way the gravitational potential approaches zero the further you get from the mass, the total influence on the velocity of the escaping object **will approach a fixed number**. (This can be shown by integrating the [[School/S6/Physics/Rotational Motion and Astrophysics/Gravitational Fields#Gravitational Potential\|gravitational potential formula]] between the position of the mass and infinity with respect to $\large r$.) This is the **escape velocity** - the **minimum velocity needed for an object to escape a gravitational pull**. In theory, if an object was launched from a potential well with precisely the escape velocity, then as it approached infinity, its velocity would also approach zero.
