## Formula

Electric field strength is the **electrical force per unit of positive charge** - similar to how gravitational field strength is the weight per unit of mass. The electric field strength can be calculated at the point of a charged particle, if the charge and mass of the particle is known:

> > - $\large \color{cyan} F$ is the **electrostatic force** acting on the particle, in newtons.
> > - $\large \color{yellow} Q$ is the **charge of the particle**, in coulombs.

### Radial Fields

Substituting $\large \color{cyan} F$ with [[School/S6/Physics/Coulomb's Law#Formula\|Coulomb's law]] causes the charge of the particle, $\large \color{yellow} Q$, to cancel out with one of the charges in the numerator - which leaves us with the below formula for **radial fields**:

> [!warning] Charge Confusion!
> This below formula can **only be used for radial fields** - it's essentially just the [[School/S6/Physics/Coulomb's Law#Formula\|Coulomb's law formula]] but with one of the particles removed, hence leaving behind a radial field.

> In this formula, $\large \color{cyan} Q$ refers to the charge of the particle which is **creating the field you're measuring** - any test charge that may be situated at the point you're trying to measure the electric field strength of doesn't matter!
