> [!question]- What is the Hall of Fame?
> This is a small social experiment I'm running, and a way to recognise the nice things people do which otherwise go unnoticed! If somebody has helped you or someone else out in some way, or is otherwise going out of their way to be nice, then please nominate them [[School/Hall of Fame#Nominate someone!\|at the bottom of this page]] or [in the form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6bT_habDEsgUznXdg217NhiNdKV6fcxXcXtcNgG8mg6EPgQ/viewform).
