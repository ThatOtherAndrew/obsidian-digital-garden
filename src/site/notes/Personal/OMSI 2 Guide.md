## Driving the Bus

Step by step - this is chronological order after choosing map and bus you want.

> [!warning] Destination display issues?
> In order for the destination display to work, you'll need to put the correct `.hof` file of the map you want to use in the folder of the bus you want to use. Most `.hof` files are universal, but please check this as there may be exceptions - especially with roller blinds!

#### <kbd>E</kbd> - ELECTRICITY 
This enables power to the bus. You'll hear a chime, 'FIRE SYSTEM PRESSURE OKAY' etc. 

#### INTERIOR LIGHTS (Optional) 
Keys <kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>8</kbd> <kbd>9</kbd> (above qwerty)
These will turn on your interior lights - you'll find switches on the dashboard if for some reason these keybinds don't work. Some buses have master light switches that need to be turned on before the actual lights - see StreetDeck.

#### EXTERIOR LIGHTS (Optional)
<kbd>L</kbd> is your standard lights and <kbd>F</kbd> are your full beams. Some newer buses will have daylight running lights as standard. (Enviro 200MMC, StreetDeck etc.)

#### <kbd>M</kbd> - IGNITION
The combination for actually turning on the engine varies. For example, the StreetDeck, Citaro and the MAN lions city all have the 'press <kbd>E</kbd> 4 times' method of turning on the engine, with each press of <kbd>E</kbd> cycling a different stage of the ignition, and then <kbd>M</kbd> to go backwards, turning off the bus. However, most will use <kbd>E</kbd> to turn on the electricity and then <kbd>M</kbd> to start the engine.
> [!hint] Engine not starting?
> The bus must be in neutral with the handbrake on in order to start/stop the engine.

#### <kbd>.</kbd> - HANDBRAKE
Your handbrake (or park brake) is <kbd>.</kbd> (Yes, the full stop button next to <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>/</kbd>). Release this once the ignition is on - if you turn it off earlier you'll get a lot of beeping. Some buses may also require you to enable the handbrake in order to open the doors - this is to prevent the bus rolling away at bus stops. This is not universal though and older buses will generally require <kbd>-</kbd> or station brake in order to open the doors - this is for dual door buses as the rear doors are automatic. The front doors can be opened once the station brake is enabled. Please check the documentation for the bus you want to drive however as these are not catch-all rules.

#### <kbd>D</kbd> <kbd>N</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd> - GEARS
To pull away, you'll now need to engage <kbd>D</kbd> for Drive. There's also <kbd>N</kbd> for Neutral and <kbd>R</kbd> for Reverse. This applies if you're driving an automatic, which I'd recommend for your first drive. Manuals include <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd>, <kbd>5</kbd> as well, which have to be changed when the rev counter maxes out in each gear. To change gears, you'll need to go VIA Neutral. So to go from Drive to Reverse you'll need to go <kbd>D</kbd> -> <kbd>N</kbd> -> <kbd>R</kbd>.  

#### <kbd>Num8</kbd> <kbd>Num5</kbd> <kbd>Num4</kbd> <kbd>Num6</kbd> - THROTTLE, BRAKE, LEFT AND RIGHT
Your throttle is <kbd>Num8</kbd> on the numpad. Left is <kbd>Num4</kbd> and Right is <kbd>Num6</kbd>. By default <kbd>Num5</kbd> is steering wheel center and Num2 is <kbd>brake</kbd> but I'd recommend swapping <kbd>Num5</kbd> and <kbd>Num2</kbd> and enabling 'automatic steering wheel center' in the general settings menu as this will make your life much easier. If you hit brake while cruising, you'll turn on the retarder and the bus will start to slow down. Tap it again and it'll go full ABS, bringing you to a halt ASAP. 

#### (<kbd>/</kbd> <kbd>*</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd>) - DOORS
Your door buttons are <kbd>/</kbd>, <kbd>*</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd>.
For UK buses, your main one is <kbd>/</kbd>. This will open the front doors and most regional buses only have a single set of doors. London buses generally use <kbd>/</kbd> for the front doors and either the station brake combo shown above or just <kbd>*</kbd> for the rear doors but this will be bus specific so please check documentation.

## Using the Control Panel
Now I'll get onto the control panel. First option is to spawn a new bus. Second is to switch buses if you have multiple spawned. Third is to delete your current bus. Fourth is to teleport your bus to an entry point of the map (usually the terminus/interchange) fifth is to activate/deactivate the computer control. If you click on any NPC bus that's out and about and click yes to switch to it, you'll need to hit this to disable the computer that's driving it so that you can drive it. Other than that you won't need for touch that option. Fifth is important. This is your route selector. This loads your start and end point and ATA. (automatic timetable analysis). It will show you how long the route will take to drive in real life minutes in the preview menu. Once loaded, press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd> to bring up the status menu - showing the current in game time, date, your speed, the name of the next stop and how delayed you are (a minus number means you're early). The 92E is your display selector, e.g. 25 city centre.

After each route, you'll get a popup showing your delays and each stop you stopped at. This is a text file and can be saved if you wish.
