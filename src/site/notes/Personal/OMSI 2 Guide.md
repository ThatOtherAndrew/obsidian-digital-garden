## Driving the Bus

Step by step - this is chronological order after choosing map and bus you want.

> [!warning] Destination display issues?
> In order for the destination display to work, you'll need to put the correct `.hof` file of the map you want to use in the folder of the bus you want to use. Most `.hof` files are universal, but please check this as there may be exceptions - especially with roller blinds!

#### <kbd>E</kbd> - ELECTRICITY 
This enables power to the bus. You'll hear a chime, 'FIRE SYSTEM PRESSURE OKAY' etc.
