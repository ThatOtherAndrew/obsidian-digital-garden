### Formation of a Beach
Deposition occurs in low-energy environments by [[Coasts and Wave Processes#Constructive and Destructive Waves|constructive waves]], forming a beach. The largest beaches usually form in bays, due to wave diffraction. Beaches are composed of rock fragments from eroded cliffs broken down by [[Coasts and Wave Processes#Hydraulic Action|hydraulic action]].

Beach material can be sorted by size, since the largest material is deposited first by the backwash as it loses energy retreating into the sea. They are also sorted by shape, as rounder material in the inter-tidal zone is subject to [[Coasts and Wave Processes#Attrition|attrition]] and flatter stones can be flipped higher up the beach onto the berm by turbulent water.

#### Explain, in detail, how particles on a beach become sorted according to size.

The swash from waves transports particles of various sizes up the beach. As the backwash retreats back into the sea, it loses energy travelling down the slope, and drops the largest particles near the top of the beach. As it loses more energy retreating further back, more particles of decreasing size are deposited, leaving the smallest particles near the bottom of the beach.

As a result, rocks and shingle are left near the top of the beach, with sand deposited closer to the sea. If the slope isn't too steep, silt and mud can also be deposited further below the sand.

### Formation of a Sandspit
A sandspit is an accumulation of sand or gravel sediment with one end attached to land and the other reaching across an estuary or into the sea. They are features of coastal deposition. Sandspits are formed when large amounts of sediment are transported by longshore drift and a shallow, sheltered area of water is left where the coastline suddenly changes direction. Over time, enough material is deposited to build up above sea level.

When the wind changes direction, it alters the direction of the waves, and this may result in some of the material at the end of the sandspit being forced inland to form a curved end. A salt marsh can often develop behind the sandspit.

### Formation of Sandbars and Tombolos
If a sandspit is deposited across a [[Formation of Bays, Headlands and Coves#Formation of Bays and Headlands|bay]], it blocks it off and forms a sandbar, with a lagoon formed behind it.

If a sandspit grows into open water and connects to an island, it forms a tombolo. Tombolos are usually quite short, as it is hard for large amounts of sediment to build up in open water.
