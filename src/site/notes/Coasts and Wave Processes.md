### Wave Formation
Wind blows over the ocean which creates friction. This drags the surface of the ocean and the water in a circular motion creating waves.

The size of waves depends on three factors:
1. Wind speed (How fast the wind is blowing)
2. Wind duration (How long the wind has been blowing for)
3. Fetch (Distance of open ocean which the wind blows over)

These factors can increase how much energy is transferred from the wind, increasing the wave size.

### Breaking Waves
As the water becomes shallower near the coast, friction against the sea bed opposes the rotational energy of the wave, causing it to grow in height as the water piles up against itself. Eventually, gravity brings the tall wave crashing down, which is called "breaking".

```ad-info
title: Where exactly does a wave break?
A water depth of 1.3 times the wave height (or less) causes the wave to break.

### Processes of Erosion
##### Hydraulic Action
- Waves pound air into cracks, forcing rock apart and breaking off chunks.

##### Solution (Corrosion)
- Salts and weak acids in the water dissolve calcareous rocks such as limestone.

##### Abrasion (Corrasion)
- Waves hurl sediment at cliffs, grinding it away like sandpaper.

##### Attrition
- Rocks bump against each other and the sea bed, making them smaller and rounder, and creating sand.
